## Twitter Sniper for Discord Invite Links

  This script monitors a specified Twitter (X) account for new tweets containing Discord invite links, extracts them, and automatically attempts to join the Discord server. It was originally built to snipe invites from @NoahreyliCustom's tweets for Fortnite customs servers, but you can easily swap the Twitter handle to target other accounts or tweak the regex to snipe different link types (e.g., other invite platforms).

  **Note**: This was coded in late 2021, and therefore uses the deprecated Twitter API v1.2 via Tweepy, so it won't work with current Twitter API restrictions. I might recode it for v2.0 if I need it again, feel free to do it yourself! :D

# Impact in Action

  After confirming the script worked, I joined the Noahreyli Customs Discord server on my first try, something others struggled with for months without a script. I also got two friends in on their first attempts, showing how effective this is for sniping Discord invite links.
